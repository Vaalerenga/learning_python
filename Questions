# instructions below
#Use while to get the user input, animal_name, of 4 animals
 use a counter, num_animals, in the while loop condition
 append the names to a string variable, all_animals
 User can exit early by typing "exit" (check if animal_name is "exit" and break)
 when the loop finishes, print the names of all_animals
 -bonus: print "no animals" if animal_name is empty after exiting the loop

 Tip: Think about Sequence and variables that need to be initialized before the while loop
 
 num_animals = 0
all_animals = animal_name
while True:
    animal_name = input("Name one animal's (type 'exit' to end program): ")
    
    if animal_name.lower() == ('exit'):
        print('no animals')
        break
    elif animal_name.isalpha():
        print(animal_name)
        num_animals += 1
    if num_animals >= 4:
        print(all_animals)
        break
